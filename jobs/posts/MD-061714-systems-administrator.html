            <p>Do you enjoy building large computer systems? Is there a cluster of networked machines at your house? Do you argue with your friends about whether zsh is better than bash? Do you have a favorite configuration management tool, like Puppet, Chef, Ansible, or Salt? Have you experimented with virtualized private server providers like Amazon Web Services, DigitalOcean, Linode, or Rackspace? Do you enjoy solving problems and automating solutions for them?</p><br>
            <p>If you answered yes to any of these questions and have a history of making an impact on projects — large or small — then we want to talk to you! Anthem Engineering is looking for system administrators who are collaborative, self-motivated, and highly skilled to join our teams. Our customers depend on us to design, implement, and maintain large virtualized infrastructures, their underlying hardware and network, and the services built on top of them. We need talented system administrators who are skilled at creating automated, repeatable solutions.</p>
